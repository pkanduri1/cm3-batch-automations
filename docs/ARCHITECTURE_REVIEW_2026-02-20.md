# Architecture Review (Critical) — 2026-02-20

Branch: `feature/architecture-review`
Reviewer stance: Test Engineering Architecture (critical review)

## Executive Summary

The platform has strong functional breadth (CLI + API + pipeline orchestration + chunked processing), but architecture quality is being held back by **orchestration sprawl**, **inconsistent contracts**, and **unsafe command execution patterns**.

Most severe risks:
1. Monolithic command orchestrator and duplicated orchestration logic.
2. `shell=True` execution of profile/config-derived commands.
3. Inconsistent report/output behavior between chunked vs non-chunked paths.
4. API and CLI behavior drift (same use-case, different quality).

---

## Key Findings

### 1) Orchestrator God Object (maintainability bottleneck)
- `src/main.py` is 1041 lines and mixes command parsing, business orchestration, output formatting, adapter wiring, and error/exit policy.
- This causes fragile changes and repeated regressions when modifying one command path.

**Evidence**
- `src/main.py` (1041 LOC)

**Impact**
- High regression risk, slow onboarding, difficult test isolation.

**Recommendation**
- Extract command handlers into modules:
  - `src/commands/parse.py`
  - `src/commands/validate.py`
  - `src/commands/compare.py`
  - `src/commands/reconcile.py`
- Keep `main.py` as Click entry/wiring only.

---

### 2) Unsafe command execution in pipeline path
- Pipeline execution uses shell invocation with config-provided command strings.

**Evidence**
- `src/pipeline/runner.py` uses `subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, ...)`.
- `src/pipeline/output_regression_suite.py` uses `subprocess.run(cmd, shell=True, ...)`.

**Impact**
- Command injection risk and quoting fragility.
- Harder cross-platform predictability.

**Recommendation**
- Replace with argument-array execution (`shell=False`) and explicit command builders.
- Restrict/validate allowed commands for pipeline profiles.
- Add tests for quoting and unsafe chars.

---

### 3) Inconsistent output contract (validate command)
- Non-chunked validate path always routes through `ValidationReporter` regardless output extension.
- Chunked path supports extension-aware behavior (`.json` vs `.html`).

**Evidence**
- `src/main.py` validate non-chunked: `reporter.generate(result, output)` (no extension switch).
- `src/main.py` chunked validate: explicit `.json`/`.html` branching.

**Impact**
- Surprising behavior and format bugs.
- Automation scripts become brittle.

**Recommendation**
- Define a single output contract for validate (both modes):
  - `.json` => machine JSON
  - `.html` => HTML
  - optional sidecars for warnings/errors
- Implement shared output writer used by both paths.

---

### 4) Layering confusion: `reporters/` vs `reporting/`
- Two similarly named packages split responsibilities ambiguously.

**Evidence**
- `src/reporters/*` (renderers) and `src/reporting/*` (result adapters)

**Impact**
- Discoverability and ownership confusion.
- Increases accidental duplication.

**Recommendation**
- Consolidate under one namespace (e.g., `src/reports/`):
  - `renderers/`
  - `adapters/`
  - `contracts/`

---

### 5) API/CLI capability drift
- API comparison endpoint is simplified and not feature-equivalent with CLI.
- Health endpoint reports static DB status with TODO.

**Evidence**
- `src/api/routers/files.py`: compare returns simplistic counts and `report_url=None` TODO.
- `src/api/routers/system.py`: `database_connected=False` TODO.

**Impact**
- Different truth depending on interface.
- Misleading API health in production contexts.

**Recommendation**
- Establish parity matrix (CLI vs API) and track gaps as explicit backlog.
- Move comparison logic to shared service used by both CLI and API.
- Implement real DB connectivity check (optional timeout, degraded status semantics).

---

### 6) Workflow script sprawl and duplication
- Multiple overlapping scripts orchestrate similar flows (`validate_data_files.py`, `run_manifest_workflow.py`, `run_regression_workflow.py`, shell/ps1 wrappers).

**Impact**
- Repeated argument parsing, telemetry logic, error handling.
- Divergent behavior over time.

**Recommendation**
- Create unified orchestration library:
  - `src/workflows/engine.py`
  - reusable stages + shared telemetry schema
- Keep scripts as thin wrappers only.

---

### 7) Config typing/validation is too loose in orchestrators
- Workflow and pipeline config consumed mostly as untyped dicts.

**Impact**
- Late runtime failures, poor error messaging.

**Recommendation**
- Add Pydantic models for pipeline/workflow config contracts.
- Validate at load-time with friendly, field-level errors.

---

### 8) CI design fragility in matrix artifact naming (already observed)
- Pipeline regression workflow previously used matrix profile path directly in artifact name.

**Impact**
- CI failures on invalid artifact characters.

**Recommendation**
- Keep sanitized matrix metadata (`source_name`) for display and artifact naming.
- Add lint/check for forbidden chars in workflow-generated identifiers.

---

### 9) Generated data + sample artifacts in repo root paths
- `data/files/*`, `reports/*` patterns are mixed with source-managed assets.

**Impact**
- Repository hygiene drift and accidental commits of generated output.

**Recommendation**
- Enforce clear generated-output directories with `.gitignore` policy.
- Separate immutable sample fixtures (`test_fixtures/`) from runtime outputs (`reports/`, temp dirs).

## Priority Fix Plan

### P0 (Immediate)
1. Replace `shell=True` pipeline execution paths. ✅
2. Standardize validate output contract (json/html parity across modes). ✅
3. Split `main.py` into command modules. ✅ (started for parse/validate/compare)

### P1 (Near-term)
4. Consolidate reporting namespace (`reporters` + `reporting`). ✅
5. API/CLI comparison parity via shared service. ✅
6. Typed config contracts for pipeline/workflow. ✅

## P1 Execution Plan (Proposed)

### Workstream A — Reporting consolidation (3-4 days)
- Create target package: `src/reports/{renderers,adapters,contracts}`
- Move:
  - `src/reporters/validation_reporter.py` -> `src/reports/renderers/validation_renderer.py`
  - `src/reporters/html_reporter.py` -> `src/reports/renderers/comparison_renderer.py`
  - `src/reporting/result_adapter_*.py` -> `src/reports/adapters/*`
- Add compatibility shims in old paths for one release cycle.
- Exit criteria:
  - imports in CLI/API/workflows use new namespace
  - all tests pass without path regressions

### Workstream B — API/CLI parity service for compare (2-3 days)
- Add shared service: `src/services/compare_service.py`
- Service inputs: files, keys, mapping, chunk options, thresholds
- Service outputs: canonical compare result contract used by both CLI and API
- Refactor:
  - CLI compare command -> service
  - API files compare endpoint -> same service (remove simplified logic)
- Exit criteria:
  - API compare supports key-based + chunked + report generation parity
  - contract tests prove identical result fields CLI vs API

### Workstream C — Typed config contracts (2-3 days)
- Add Pydantic models:
  - `src/contracts/pipeline_profile.py`
  - `src/contracts/regression_workflow.py`
- Validate config at load-time in:
  - `src/pipeline/runner.py`
  - `scripts/run_regression_workflow.py`
  - `scripts/run_manifest_workflow.py`
- Emit actionable validation errors with path + field.
- Exit criteria:
  - invalid configs fail fast with deterministic messages
  - unit tests for happy path + representative invalid configs

### Suggested delivery slices
1) Slice 1: Reporting consolidation + shims ✅
2) Slice 2: Compare shared service + API parity ✅
3) Slice 3: Typed config contracts + migration tests ✅

### P1 Completion Notes (2026-02-21)
- Shared compare service added at `src/services/compare_service.py` and consumed by:
  - CLI compare command (`src/commands/compare_command.py`)
  - API compare endpoint (`src/api/routers/files.py`)
- Typed contracts added:
  - `src/contracts/pipeline_profile.py`
  - `src/contracts/regression_workflow.py`
- Contract validation wired into:
  - `src/pipeline/runner.py`
  - `scripts/run_regression_workflow.py`
- Verification:
  - targeted unit tests for command/api/service/contracts pass
  - `scripts/run_regression_workflow.py` PASS
  - `run-pipeline --dry-run` PASS

### Risks / mitigations
- Risk: import breakage during namespace move
  - Mitigation: temporary compatibility modules and deprecation warnings
- Risk: behavior drift while unifying compare
  - Mitigation: golden-result fixtures consumed by both CLI and API tests
- Risk: strict Pydantic validation blocks existing loose configs
  - Mitigation: support `model_config = extra='ignore'` initially, tighten after migration

### P2 (Medium-term) — IN PROGRESS
7. Unify scripts onto shared workflow engine.
8. Formal architecture decision records (ADRs) for parsing/validation/reporting boundaries.

### Status Update
- P1: ✅ COMPLETE
- P2: 🚧 STARTED

### P2 Kickoff Plan (next execution slice)
1. Create `src/workflows/engine.py` with reusable stage runners (`parse`, `validate`, `compare`). ✅
2. Refactor `scripts/run_manifest_workflow.py` and `scripts/run_regression_workflow.py` into thin wrappers over workflow engine. ✅ (initial pass)
3. Add ADRs:
   - `docs/adr/0001-boundary-cli-services.md`
   - `docs/adr/0002-validation-reporting-boundaries.md`
4. Add integration tests to prove wrapper parity before/after engine extraction.

## Suggested Target Architecture (north star)

- `src/commands/*` (CLI-only thin handlers)
- `src/services/*` (core business workflows)
- `src/reports/{adapters,renderers,contracts}`
- `src/workflows/*` (pipeline/manifest/regression engine)
- `src/api/*` calling shared services only

This will reduce drift, remove duplicated orchestration code, and make test architecture significantly cleaner.
