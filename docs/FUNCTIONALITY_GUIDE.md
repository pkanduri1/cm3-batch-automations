# Functionality Guide (Consolidated)

This document was consolidated to remove redundancy.

Use these canonical docs instead:

- `docs/FUNCTIONALITY_MATRIX.md` (complete capability matrix)
- `docs/USAGE_GUIDE.md` (hands-on command examples)
- `docs/architecture.md` (system architecture and flows)
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` (full navigation)
