    """Delete files older than max_age_hours from directory.

    Walks the top-level directory (non-recursive) and removes any file whose
    modification time is older than max_age_hours * 3600 seconds.  Subdirectories
    are never deleted.  Per-file errors are collected and returned rather than
    raised so that a single unreadable file cannot abort an entire cleanup run.

    Args:
        directory: Path to the directory to clean.
        max_age_hours: Maximum age of files to keep, in hours. Defaults to 24.

    Returns:
        dict with keys:
            deleted_count (int): Number of files deleted.
            deleted_bytes (int): Total bytes freed.
            errors (list[str]): Human-readable error messages for failed deletes.
